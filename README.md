## Description

[Tweeter](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/rleoQc34THclWx1cFFKH) is a project idea from [devChallenges](https://devchallenges.io) for developers who wants to learn new skills.
As I wanted to learn [Nestjs](https://nestjs.com/) framework since months ago I choose nest for my backend.

## Objectives

DevChallenges propose to complete all of these user histories:

- I can register an account
- I can sign in with my account
- I can see my profile or others' profile
- When I am on a profile, I can see Tweets and Retweets. I can also filter by Tweets, Tweets and replies, Media and Likes
- When I am on a profile, I can see followers and following
- When I am on a profile, I can see follow or unfollow the user
- I can navigate between Home, Explore and Bookmarks
- I can navigate to My Profile, Group Chat (optional), Setting/Authentication App.
- When I am on Home, I can post a new Tweet
- When I post a new Tweet, I can choose to upload an image and set the Tweet to be public or only-follower
- When I am on Home, I can see Tweets of people who I follow
- I can Comment, Retweet, Like or Save a Tweet
- I can Comment with image and I can like a comment
- I can see the posted time of the Comments and Tweets
- When I am on Home, I can see the most popular hashtags and people I should follow (it's up to you how to implement this)
- When I am on Explore, I can see the Top, Latest Tweet, or Tweet with Media. I can also choose to see the most popular people
- When I am on Bookmarks, I can see the Saved Tweet
- (optional): I can search for a group
